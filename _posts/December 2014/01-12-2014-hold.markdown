This past year has really given me a ton of hard choices to make. 

I had to make one of the scariest decisions of my life recently. I decided that I'm going to put all my obligations on hold for a while, and focus on my health and sanity instead.

I'll be taking a sabbatical of sorts until May or September. I've deferred my acceptance into Graduate studies and I've trimmed down my obligations to be almost nothing. 

I am really hopeful that taking this break will give me time to grow and flourish and be the best that I can be.
