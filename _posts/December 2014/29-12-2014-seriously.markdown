I took a train ride today. I am staying in Quebec City for new years. 

I dislike travel. Travelling stresses me out in a way that nothing else quite does. I don't do well in cramped spaces and I'm not a small person. I don't mind trains because usually they are relaxing and nice and spacious.

*Usually.*

See, some people don't understand the concept of "others." They were apparently never taught as children to, I don't know, not yell to eachother from other ends of the train, or not to play a game of "how loud can we be" go fish.
