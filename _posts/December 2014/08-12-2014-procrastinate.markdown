Our brains sort of suck. There are a billion different things that can go wrong with it, it gets worse as you get older and if we are being real here it really likes to mess with us too.

Procrastination is the worst thing our brains can do to us. 

It's exam time, and a lot of the stress around us is because of procrastinating and apathy finally catching up to everyone. 

Why is it that I know I have to study for say, my final tomorrow, but instead I'm writing this blog post? Why am I able to spend time playing with my cat or watching TV but studying is for *later?*

I'd love to go on a long rant about *wanting* to do things vs *needing* to do them, or talk about how doing unrelated but still "productive" things makes it a lot easier to ignore the impending dealines, but I don't see why I can't just do it tomorrow instead.<sup>lol</sup>
