I didn't ever meet the girl who died. My girlfriend Kelly went to high school with her and I went with her because she asked me to. 

We piled into a car and drove an hour to the funeral home. We ended up at the wrong one first, but we found our way to the right place along with the others who made the same mistake.

When we arrived, I was struck by the number of people who came on Thursday afternoon to pay their respects. The service began and several moving speeches were made. They all talked about how smart, driven and beautiful she was, and how much of a loss it was to lose her. 

After the service we all went downstairs to talk and eat. Her high school class started talking and reconnecting so I wandered off to let Kelly reminisce with her old friends. I decided look at pictures and read all the things people were writing about the girl, and it struck me that since I didn't know her at all the only experience I had of her was this.

I was learning a lot about her from listening to people talk, and I realized that I really wish I could have met this person. When people die, everyone close to them will generally remember the good times and the great things about that person. I've been to lots of funerals and never heard people talk about anyone so sincerely and I honestly am not sure if I'm just interpreting it as sincere because I didn't know her so I know nothing to the contrary or if she was really just that amazing of a person.

I'm really sorry for anyone who has lost someone recently. This time of year is the worst to lose someone in.

I hope when I die, I have people saying similar things about me.
