An exam was sprung on me a week or so ago. I had no idea I'd be taking this exam until then. Needless to say it was a stressful experience.

My first reaction was one of extreme anxiety. Could I study enough in a week to pass? I looked through the content I'd be tested on and I realized that it was totally doable. 

It's weird how you can know exactly what you have to do and in what timeframe it has to be done, but you'll still get the urge to procrastinate. I was so anxious for it that I ended up actually procrastinating a lot for a couple days.

I wrote the exam on Friday, and I'm glad I ended up doing it. It was a very stressful but overall I'm just happy with myself for managing to get it done. I'm not actually sure how I did, but I studied hard and I feel like I knocked it out of the park.
