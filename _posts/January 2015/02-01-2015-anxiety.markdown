A little less than a year ago, I wrote a big [Facebook Post](https://www.facebook.com/lmarcelli/posts/10152018814027957?pnref=story) about mental health. Looking back at this moment, I realized that it was the start of a new era for me.

Nine months has passed and thankfully, I'm doing much better now than I was back then. Living with an Anxiety Disorder for so many years without even knowing that it was the reason I felt so terrible all the time was not a fun time.

The post includes a lot about how people are not accepting and accomodating to mental illness in the same way as say cancer or a visible disability, but over the last year I'm happy to say that I have been proven wrong.

I found support at every turn. I had to take the first step myself, which is something we still need to work on making easier, but once I did, the support came pouring in. 

If you're struggling this year, please reach out. I'm always here. 

I love you all <3.
