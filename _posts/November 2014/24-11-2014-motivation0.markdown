It's that time again of year everybody - exam time! This is definitely a time of year when things start to get a *bit* intense for everyone. 

[Stress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28biology) is something that every person and animal has in common. It is what drives us and keeps us back all at the same time. There isn't anyone person in the world who isn't stressed about someone or something.Look around you next time you're on campus. Everyone else here is going through the same thing you are. Exams are around the corner and 99% of us are floundering and making things up as we go along.

Are you ready for that exam? Are you on track with that paper? No? Neither am I! Neither is the person sitting to your left in class, or your friend that just texted you. You just don't see it. 

This time of year is really rough for a lot of people, but you're not alone. You're never alone. Our school has a ton of great services to help you, both in academics and in [other](http://www.queensu.ca/hcds) very useful ways. Just this semster I know of myself, my girlfriend and several friends who received support and accomodations from all three services - Health, Counselling and Disability. As I've become more open with my own school anxiety, I've learned that: 

1. There are way more resources than I thought possible.
2. There are way more people feeling and struggling similarly to me than I thought possible. 

If you're struggling badly, reach out for help. If you're not struggling and you see someone who is, see what you can do. Nobody has to do this alone. 

We are all in this together.
