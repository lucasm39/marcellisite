	<p class="under-img-text">Look outside! It's snowing! It's so pretty! Wanna build a snowman?</p>
</div>

Me today when I was walking outside:

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014-nov-posts/icerobot.gif">
	<p class="under-img-text">Shit shit shit shit</p>
</div>

That is the end of this blog post.
