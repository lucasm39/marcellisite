      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like music I didn’t used to like.</p>

<p>It’s really odd to realize that. I’ve changed a lot over the years and I already made a <a href="/2014/11/25/life/">post</a> on how weird it is to look back and see how you’ve changed, but today I had a weird realization. </p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2015Jan/watsky.png" title="I actually hate him." />
</div>

<p>It might not seem like much, but young me was really opposed to rap music of any kind. It’s weird how we can have these odd little reminders that things are changing each day. If you ever doubt that you’re different, just take a look at something innocous like your music tastes or the way you like your toast in the morning. It might surprise you.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really like space. </p>

<p>Since I was little, my eyes have always been on the sky. There was a point in my life where I was on track to become an astronomer, but the math kicked my butt a bit too hard and my professional pursuits took a turn toward Computer Science.</p>

<p>The Universe is an amazing place. It’s a vast expanse of emptiness with pockets of brilliance spattered throughout. Have you ever seen the universe at its largest scale?</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2015Jan/cosmos.jpg" title="Wow." />
	<p> This is a simulation, obviously </p>
</div>

<p>Superclusters of galaxies clump into tendrils, with giant expanses of space between. What you’re looking at here is the structure of the universe simulated by using actual positions of galaxies. Each of those tendrils is billions of galaxies large. Galaxies are <em>huge,</em> spanning hundreds of billions of stars. The header on my main page is a good example of a galaxy:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/headers/home-bg.jpg" title="Oooooooooh" />
</div>

<p>Most of those bright lights are stars. Some of them are also galaxies, containing billions of stars. Others are globular clusters, which <em>only</em> have thousands to millions of stars. Our galaxy is called the Milky Way. It has 1 to 200 billion stars in it. We orbit one, called Sol. It’s also known as the Sun.</p>

<p>We have a small vantage point, which looks like this to the rest of the universe:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2015Jan/dot.jpg" />
	<p> Pale Blue Dot </p>
</div>

<p>How small exactly? We pointed the Hubble Space Telescope at a seemingly empty part of the sky for months and months and months. This portion of the sky is about one tenth the size of the full Moon. What we saw was completely unprecedented and is called the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2015Jan/ultra.jpg" />
	<p> Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa </p>
</div>

<p>In that small, black space, this many galaxies can be seen. There is only two or three non galaxies in that picture. These galaxies are over 13.4 billion light years away, which means you are seeing them as they were 13.4 billion years ago. </p>

<p>This is our universe. This is the scale. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field spans nearly nothing of the full scale of the universe, yet that picture contains thousands of galaxies. </p>

<p>Whenever I feel down, I look at the sky and I realize that I’m a part of all this. The universe is so huge, so mind-bogglingly large that we can barely comprehend it. People like to seperate themselves from it all, but when I say the universe I mean <em>the Universe.</em> That includes me, you and everyone else. It includes human spirit and fortitude. The Universe is a huge amazing thing, but it’s so much bigger because it has us trying to survive and understand the things it throws at us. </p>

<p>Space is so cool.</p>

      <title>RSS is live</title>

      <description><![CDATA[I added an RSS feed for this blog yesterday.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I added an <a href="/rss.xml">RSS feed</a> for this blog yesterday. </p>

<p>Adding RSS to jekyll blogs is supposed to be very easy. However, most people will publish their blogs with Github Pages, but I do it the old fashioned way with an nginx server. This led to some problems that I had to solve in an interesting way. </p>

<p>When I deploy my blog to nginx, it builds the blog remotely and serves it. I found a nice plugin to generate an <code>rss.xml</code> for me everytime it builds, but for some reason this didn’t work on the remote server. I deduced it to be the fact that I need an <code>rss.xml</code> in the main tree of my files, but the plugin generates it under <code>_site.</code></p>

<p>So I wrote a couple lines into my deploment script:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/lucasmarcelli/fceb6a1f9b6046d38e2e.js"></script>

<p>All this does is copy the generated one from <code>_site</code> to the main directory, so that the server could build the proper <code>rss.xml.</code> But it didn’t work. It was getting an old version of the RSS. </p>

<p>Then today I realized how to fix it. </p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/lucasmarcelli/41defc40a5d7ca25d802.js"></script>

<p>The build command was builing it just fine, but what was happening is the plugin would build the rss.xml in <code>_site</code>, then jekyll would rebuild the one in <code>_site</code> out of the one I have in the main directory. This meant that I was essentially copying the same file back. I simply remove the file first, then build and it works like magic!</p>

<p>The biggest thing I’ve noticed is the lack of communication. The games where I communicate with my team, we all do a lot better. Since I got a mic, I’ve been winning all my games. Hopefully I’ll be out of silver and into Nova soon.</p>

<p>Weird post, but I thought I’d share. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A little less than a year ago, I wrote a big <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lmarcelli/posts/10152018814027957?pnref=story">Facebook Post</a> about mental health. Looking back at this moment, I realized that it was the start of a new era for me.</p>

<p>Nine months has passed and thankfully, I’m doing much better now than I was back then. Living with an Anxiety Disorder for so many years without even knowing that it was the reason I felt so terrible all the time was not a fun time.</p>

<p>The post I made addressed the issue of so people not having an understanding, and therefore failing to accommodate those with mental illness in the same way as a visible disability, or a bodily illness like cancer. I know that my story and opportunities aren’t necessarily representative of everyone but over the last year I’m happy to say that I have been proven wrong.</p>

<p>Since being more open about my anxiety, I have found support at every turn. I had to take the first step myself, which is something we still need to work on making easier. Once I did though, the support came pouring in. Beyond that, I’ve learned how many people around me, many of whom I am friends with, are dealing with mental illness issues. </p>

<p>If you’re struggling this year, please reach out. I’m always here. </p>

<p>I love you all &lt;3.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recent launch of my <a href="/projects">projects</a> page, I ran into a whole set of problems. The first most obvious one is the lack of mobile support, but I’m working on that. A much more subtle and annoying one is this:
<br /></p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/before.png" title="Seriously." />
	<p> Before Mouseover </p>
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/after.png" title="Seriously." />
	<p> After Mouseover </p>
</div>

<p>If you don’t see it, look at the portrait of Euler. It gets slightly smaller after mousing over for no real reason. </p>

<p>This drove me insane. I spent a long time in the “inspect element” portion of chrome trying different things, but then I realized something, what if I’m approaching it all wrong?</p>

<p>First I swapped the positions. I noticed that the first table cell always shrinks, regardless of whats in it. So I came up with a really elegant solution.</p>

<p>I made an empty table cell like this:
<br /></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/lucasmarcelli/b8eb146408783fd3ddb4.js"> </script>

<p>and used the !important tag in the css file to override what gets inherited and make it an invisible cell.</p>

<p><br />
<script src="https://gist.github.com/lucasmarcelli/4cd273b4cee214656d66.js"> </script></p>

<p>This worked perfectly! ..Now for the stretch into a metaphor!</p>

<p>Sometimes the answer requires a lot of creativity. Prepare to deal with problems in a way that you might not expect. It was certainly not my first thought to make an empty cell, but when I came up with the solution it really felt like it should have been staring me in the face. Remember that the tools you use to solve problems are dumb and that often enough, your own creativity that will end up getting you a great solution.</p>

<p>Coming up with creative solutions is really important, especially in programming. We’d still be using bubble sort if no one thought to improve the way we do things creatively. Learning how to program really does teach you to think out of the box, and it can be applied to real life too. Don’t give up on any problems, always strive to push forward and come up with better ways to do things.</p>

<p>As always, I love you all. </p>

      <title>Problem 1</title>
      <link>http://marcelli.ca/2014/12/26/euler0/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[I’ve been doing Project Euler for year and have always wanted to document the process. Documentation is a good skill to have, and I am always trying to refine the best ways to help teach others programming skills. I won’t necessarily be doing the problems in order, but it should be pretty close. I’ll give thorough explanations for my code and my processes in understanding how to tackle the problems as I go along. However, the first couple problems are incredibly easy.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been doing Project Euler for year and have always wanted to document the process. Documentation is a good skill to have, and I am always trying to refine the best ways to help teach others programming skills. I won’t necessarily be doing the problems in order, but it should be pretty close. I’ll give thorough explanations for my code and my processes in understanding how to tackle the problems as I go along. However, the first couple problems are incredibly easy.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t make much sense to do a long winded solution, so I’m going to use this post to simply introduce the idea. On my <a href="http://github.com/lucasmarcelli/euler">Github</a> the euler repo will contain all the code I run to come to my solutions. Each post will solve one problem, and each problem will have a folder, including code that doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Directly after solving problem 1, this comes up:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/euler.png" title="Lol" />
</div>

<p>However I looked around online and there is already a ton of solutions out readily available, so I don’t even feel bad. </p>

<p>The first problem is nice and straightforward:</p>

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/lucasmarcelli/euler/blob/master/Problem-1/problem1.py?slice=0:2&amp;footer=0"></script>

<p>And the solution is similarly straightforward. Simply loop from 0 to 1000 and mod by 5 or 3. If either i mod 5 or i mod 3 is 0, add it to a running sum:</p>

<script src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/github/lucasmarcelli/euler/blob/master/Problem-1/problem1.py?slice=3:&amp;footer=0"></script>

<p>This sum will give you the answer you need to solve the problem!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being Italian means I was raised very strictly Roman Catholic. Church every week, singing in choir, altar serving to the point of receiving a medal for my years of service to the Holy See. </p>

<p>Catholicism values family above most things, especially in Italy. Not going home for Christmas is one of the things that will set my dear mother off, speaking of which, meet my mom:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/mom.jpg" title="Snow!" />
	<p>What kind of psycho runs in this weather?</p>
</div>

<p>My mother Sandra is a wonderful person. She is really caring and will go to the ends of the earth to try and make anything you need happen. She’s a wonderful cook and I don’t think anyone else in the world can keep a place clean like she can. She doesn’t always get along with me, but that’s mostly my fault I guess. We just have really strong ideas about what the right things to do are, and they often differ. That being said, I wouldn’t trade her for anyone or anything. My mom is always on my side, even if I don’t realize it. The biggest thing I learned over the last few years is <em>maybe</em> I should listen to my mom. Her strength and preserverance while immigrating and everything she has accomplished since is insanely impressive.</p>

<p>Next up is my dad.</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/dad.jpg" title="Are those cops?" />
	<p>Sandra that tickles! Stop!</p>
</div>

<p>My dad Ezio is hilariously awkward. Soft-spoken and gentle, when my dad gets angry he is really angry. Very much the opposite of my mom in a lot of ways, but they work really well together. My dad has a great Italian accent and often misspeaks in pretty funny ways, but he always knows what to say to make me feel better when I’m down. My dad is an amazing artist and worked really hard along with my mom when they immigrated here 30 years ago. We went from being fairly poor to having a beautiful house and enough money to be secure and happy thanks to the hard work that my dad put in every day, and still does. He is also an expert craftsmen, redoing our entire kitchen almost by himself recently, along with my mom:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/kitchen.jpg" title="You did this yourself?" />
	<p>Who needs help. I'll just do everything! That way it's exactly how i want it.</p>
</div>

<p>My dad is a classic perfectionist and sometimes it grates on my nerves. The worst part is I can feel myself starting to become the same way. My dad is always on my side and I wouldn’t trade him for anything either.</p>

<p>Now for my brother:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/david.jpg" title="I am the best chef" />
	<p>That beard tho.</p>
</div>

<p>My brother and I are very alike but not actually at all. Anyone who knows both of us will tell you that there have never been two more different personalities that are immediate family. My brother and I both enjoy the same things, but while I’m an outspoken, often annoying, energy filled whirlwind (unless I’m at home, then I just like lazing around), David is a very reserved, soft spoken and quiet presence. He is 8 years older than me but has never let that stop him from being close with me. My brother is one of my very best friends and there is no other person I’d rather have playing dota or cs with me. We like to get together and just play video games in the same room, or go eat out. David is also the most talented chef in the world (okay I might be biased). His food is the thing I look forward to the most when I come home, and every time I go to eat at his workplace <a href="http://www.buca.ca/king">Buca</a> I am always so thoroughly satisfied I can’t eat the next day. He is always behind me when I need him, even when he can’t actively do anything to help. I feel a lot stronger knowing that he is supporting me.</p>

<p>Next up is his wonderful wife, and my sister-in-law Jennifer!</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/jenny.jpg" title="So cute" />
	<p>What a cute couple.</p>
</div>

<p>Jenny has been a part of my family since I was 12 or something. David brought her home after his cooking class one day, and the first thing she did was help me with my french homework. This obviously made 12 year old me love her and I’ve never changed that opinion since. Jenny is always laughing and is the easiest person to talk to in the world. In fact, if you ever feel awkward and Jenny is around, just start a conversation with her! She’s amazing at keeping the conversation going naturally and seamlessly, and she can probably talk enough for both of you! Jenny is the best sister I could have ever asked for, and I’m not actually sure how David managed to land such a wonderful wife. </p>

<p>Now we arrive at the baby!</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/siena.jpg" title="So cute" />
	<p>AaaaaaaaAAaAAAaaAAaAaaaAAaAaAaaaaaAAAAaaaA</p>
</div>

<p>Siena is the child of David and Jenny. She is 2.5 but is the size of a 4 year old. Volleyball and Basketball might be in her future. She has a very unique personality and is awfully manipulative for a baby. Hanging out with her she will make you feel like you’re literally her favourite personÉ but then the next person will get the same treatment. She is the cutest baby I have ever met (lol bias, but actually look at her come on). I love her to bits and the hardest thing about being away for school is being away from this little bundle of joy.</p>

<p>Then there is my cat and Kelly, but they’ll get their own posts later.</p>

<p>I love my family. I wouldn’t trade them for anything. Everyone should take a minute to think about what you love about your family. I was almost in tears writing this because I realized how important they are to me and how often I forget.</p>

<p>Enjoy the holidays everyone.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday was my birthday. I really enjoyed myself. I spent the day with Kelly just chilling and it was really nice. </p>

<p>First my brother got me this sick whiteboard:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/whiteboard.jpg" title="On a roll today." />
	<p>It's so large!<sup><sup>Thats what she said</sup></sup> Oh, it also gets shorter when not in use.<sup><sup>THATS WHAT SHE SAID</sup></sup>  </p>
</div>

<p>I <em>love</em> whiteboards so much. There is no better tool for a programmer than a whiteboard. You can map out your problems and erase and change things as easy as typing things on an IDE. Every programmer should have a whiteboard. I think I have three or four in this house right now.</p>

<p>Then Kelly and I spent the day relaxing for the first time since exams started. </p>

<p>After that came the scary part. Kelly made me dinner.</p>

<p>Kelly is the kind of girl who could burn water on the stove. I was very apprehensive but…</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/food.jpg" title="PO-TAY-TOE" />
	<p> Mmmmmmmm </p>
</div>

<p>It turned out great! Asparagus, mashed potatoes, pork chops and carmalized apples. She picked a hard one but it tasted so good. </p>

<p>Next was dessert. She made me rice krispy squares! I don’t like cake all that much so it was really nice.</p>

<p>Then we did this:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/fort.jpg" title="The rope is literally the reason this works." />
	<p> NO GIRLS ALLOWED </p>
</div>

<p>Forts! I love forts! If you’re ever feeling down, make a fort. </p>

<p>That was my birthday.</p>

<p>Every year I also like to make a list of things I learned that year. It’s often short because I’m stubborn. Here it is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s okay to not be okay.</li>
  <li>Life has a funny way of working out if you set reasonable goals.</li>
  <li>Asking for help is key.</li>
  <li>Life is too short to waste with people or things you don’t really like.</li>
  <li>I really do love what I do.</li>
</ul>

<p>And lastly, thank you everyone for your birthday wishes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I use <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to serve this blog. One of my favourite parts about it is that it will regenerate your website locally as you save files without having to do anything, like so:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/regen.png" title="Ignore the error." />
</div>

<p>I was trying to work on the layout a bit, but no matter what I did when I saved, it would make me exit the process and restart it with <code>jekyll serve</code>.</p>

<p>I missed something small: </p>

<p><code>--watch</code></p>

<p>The <code>watch</code> flag tells Jekyll to regenerate any changes, as long as they aren’t part of <code>config.yml</code>.</p>

<p>I decided to take that silly mistake as a metaphor. Things won’t change if you’re not looking for the opportunity and acting accordingly. When different situations come your way, you have to make sure you see them for what they are and change what needs to be changed. </p>

<p>This might all be a bit of a strech, but I’m in a motivating mood. </p>

<p>And as always, I love you all &lt;3.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our brains sort of suck. There are a billion different things that can go wrong with it, it weakens as you age, and - if we are being real here - it really likes to mess with us too.</p>

<p>Procrastination is one of the worst thing our brains can do to us. </p>

<p>It is exam time, and a lot of the stress around us is self-inflicted because of procrastinating and apathy finally catching up to everyone. </p>

<p>Why is it that I know I have to study for my final exam tomorrow, but instead I’m writing this blog post? Why am I able to so easily justify spending my time playing with my cat or watching TV but studying is for <em>later?</em></p>

<p>I should go on a long rant about <em>wanting</em> to do things vs <em>needing</em> to do them, or talk about how doing unrelated, but still “productive” things makes it a lot easier to ignore the impending dealines… but I don’t see why I can’t just do that tomorrow instead.<sup>lol</sup></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I really can not get to sleep. </p>

<p>I’m writing this at 3:47 AM, though it probably wont be published until later. I’m not tired. I am just sitting here typing instead of in bed with my cat.</p>

<p>I didn’t waste these hours at least. I did some website work! Yay! (also I played a lot of counter strike)</p>

<p>It started when I noticed load times going higher on the site after posting my previous post. I knew it was the first time my droplet at Digital Ocean needed to actually handle a bit of traffic, so I went to go check on it and looked at the graphs:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/graph.png" />
	<p>Obligatory /r/dataisbeautiful</p>
</div>

<p>It really intrigued me to see the spikes in the data. I wanted to know more, but the graphs don’t show anything more detailed than bandwidth. I decided to set up the blog with Google analytics to track my data!</p>

<p>I set off on the quest which would surely challenge my coding abili—</p>

<p>Wait… all I need to do is add this piece of javascript to my default.html? Man I love Jekyll layouts. </p>

<p>This feels too easy. Is it really that easy?</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/newgraph.png" />
	<p>Yes. Yes it is.</p>
</div>

<p>Now I can see if people actually like my blog! Yay!</p>

<p>Wait, is that <em>realtime</em> visit data? Wow Google, that’s pretty awesome.  </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This past year has really given me a ton of hard choices to make. </p>

<p>I had to make one of the scariest decisions of my life recently. I decided that I’m going to put all (many) my obligations on hold for a while, and focus on my health and sanity instead.</p>

<p>The craziest thing is that I thought I had <em>definitely</em> already made the toughest/most important decisions of the year back in the early months of 2014. I guess being an adult means these come more often, which is kind of terrifying but it just means all the more opportunities to take a look at your priorities and improve yourself. </p>

<p>I’ll be taking a sabbatical of sorts until May or September. I’ve deferred my Grad school acceptance into and I’ve trimmed down my obligations to try to give myself the least stressful time possible so I can really focus on the most important ones - obligations to myself - and learn how to balance those with my future in research and grad school. </p>

<p>I’ve realized how terrifying it is to completely change your 5, or even 2 year plan, and that the people who surround me are equally terrified. The easiest decision is always no decision, to stay on the exact same track as before and remain passive. Hopefully this is for the best but I encourage everyone to take some time to reevaluate where you are going if you make no changes and if you’re happy with that. Deviating from the plan is scary but when it is necessary, it can be the most rewarding thing. </p>

<p>I am really hopeful that taking this break will give me time to grow and flourish and be the best that I can be. Making this website is Step 1. Making this post is Step 2.</p>

      <title>Generating the Kitty Page</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="/kitty">I really like my cat.</a></p>

<p>I wanted to make a page where I could drop photos of my cat and they would automagically populate the page, but since I’m using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, which only serves static content, this proved to be a bit more complicated than I expected.</p>

<p>My initial idea was to simply to loop through a folder of cleverly named photos (1.jpg, 2.jpg etc) using a liquid for loop, like so:</p>

<p><code></code> <br />
     <code>&lt;img src="/img/bitty/1.jpg"&gt;</code> <br />
<code></code> <br />
     <code>&lt;img src="/img/bitty/2.jpg"&gt;</code> <br />
<code></code> <br />
     <code>&lt;img src="/img/bitty/3.jpg"&gt;</code> <br />
<code></code> <br />
     <code>&lt;img src="/img/bitty/4.jpg"&gt;</code> <br />
<code></code> <br />
     <code>&lt;img src="/img/bitty/5.jpg"&gt;</code> <br />
<code></code></p>

<p>This is actually a pretty elegant solution, but it has some problems. For one, every time I would want put a new photo in, I’d  have to increase the counter manually each time. This would also not allow me to include my genius little blurb underneath each photo.</p>

<p>I knew that Jekyll wouldn’t give me anything like this out of the box, so this would have to be done through some sort of plugin. I <em>also</em> knew that I couldn’t be the only person who had ever wanted something like this, a suspicion that a quick Google search <a href="https://github.com/sillylogger/jekyll-directory/blob/master/_plugins/directory_tag.rb">confirmed</a>.</p>

<p>This plugin generates a directory list according to the sames rules as <code>ls</code> on unix systems. I realized that by naming my pictures what I want the blurb to be, I could append it underneath using the <code>slug</code> attribute it creates for me. However, the files would be listed in alphabetical order. I wanted Bitty’s photos displayed in chronological order, with the newest at the top.</p>

<p>It was almost perfect! I just added one little line of code:</p>

<p><code>slug.gsub!(/\d+/, '')</code></p>

<p>This removed any numbers from <code>slug</code>, which means I could prepend numbers to my filenames to make them showup in the order I wanted. I chose to prepend them with 3 digits, effectivley giving me 899 photos on the page before I have to figure out a better way. This resulted in a pretty funny looking folder:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Nov/result.png" title="So much kitty" />
	<p>I wonder how long it'll be until I need to use 4 digits...</p>
</div>

<p>Once I did that, all that was left was simply writing a for loop like so:</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class="img-center"&gt;</code> <br />
     <code></code> <br />
          <code>&lt;img src="/img/bitty/152Let me show you how it works.jpg"</code> <br />

          <code>&lt;p&gt;Let me show you how it works&lt;/p&gt;</code> <br />

              <code>alt="151Meow.jpg"</code> <br />
              <code>datetime="2015-01-09T07:19:06-05:00"/&gt;</code> <br />

<p>With the <code>img-center</code> class looking like so:</p>

<p><code>.img-center {</code> <br />
     <code>text-align: center;</code> <br />
<code>}</code> <br />
<code>.img-center img {</code> <br />
     <code>max-width: 100%;</code> <br />
<code>}</code> <br />
<code>.img-center p {</code> <br />
     <code>font-size: 85%;</code> <br />
     <code>margin-top: 5px;</code> <br />
     <code>font-style: italic;</code> <br />
<code>}</code></p>

<p>And then it worked like magic!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever sat down and thought about the way you were a year ago?</p>

<p>Today I decided to do that.</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Nov/shame.gif" />
	<p>Oh God Why?</p>
</div>

<p>It was kind of horrible. It is so weird how much change can happen in both someone’s person and life in only a year. I’m not even remotely the same person I was then, but I like to think most of that change has been growth. </p>

<p>I think back to some of the situations I was in, and how I decided to handle them a year ago. I wish I could go back in time and smack some sense into me, but I learned so many lessons that are making me a way better person. </p>

<p>I wonder what year-from-now-me will look back on and cringe at? I’ve made a number of pretty big decisions recently and I have no idea if I any of my choices were the right ones or how they are going to alter my life. It’s easy to fall into a trap of trying to live in a way that you think two-year-from-now-me will look back on happily. It’s not possible to know, because our experiences shape us and guide us. It’s important to stay grounded and live for the present you. </p>

<p>The choices you make today can change your life. Sometimes you have to make the hard choices to make sure you can move forward and most of the time you have no idea if it is the right one. My life sort of did a 180 a little less than a year ago and its been a terrifying rollercoaster ever since, but one thing I look back on is really comforting:</p>

<p><em>I’m doing better now than I was before.</em> Every single day this is true. Each day I am getting stronger and happier and my anxiety ebbs away. I have a new cat, apartment, Christmas tree and 5 year plan. I don’t know what year-from-now-me would think about how I am living my life right now, but I know year-ago-me would be ecstatic. </p>

<p>Let’s hope I can say the same thing in a year!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time again of year everybody - exam time! This is definitely a time of year when things start to get a <em>bit</em> intense for everyone. </p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28biology">Stress</a> is something that every person and animal has in common. It is what drives us and keeps us back all at the same time. There isn’t anyone person in the world who isn’t stressed about someone or something.Look around you next time you’re on campus. Everyone else here is going through the same thing you are. Exams are around the corner and 99% of us are floundering and making things up as we go along.</p>

<p>Are you ready for that exam? Are you on track with that paper? No? Neither am I! Neither is the person sitting to your left in class, or your friend that just texted you. You just don’t see it. </p>

<p>This time of year is really rough for a lot of people, but you’re not alone. You’re never alone. Our school has a ton of great services to help you, both in academics and in <a href="http://www.queensu.ca/hcds">other</a> very useful ways. Just this semster I know of myself, my girlfriend and several friends who received support and accomodations from all three services - Health, Counselling and Disability. As I’ve become more open with my own school anxiety, I’ve learned that: </p>

<ol>
  <li>There are way more resources than I thought possible.</li>
  <li>There are way more people feeling and struggling similarly to me than I thought possible. </li>
</ol>

<p>If you’re struggling badly, reach out for help. If you’re not struggling and you see someone who is, see what you can do. Nobody has to do this alone. </p>

<p>We are all in this together.</p>

      <title>Christmas Lights Suck</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My various devices all inform me that it is 2014. In fact, it’s almost 2015, and I’m almost 22 years old.</p>

<p>In recent memory we’ve done some extraordinary things. In the last year alone we’ve: </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_%28spacecraft%29">Landed on a Comet</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/02/140203093521.htm">Developed a single molocule LED</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/news/524286/a-robotic-hand-this-time-with-feeling/">A robotic hand capable of touch was developed</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-007">Took the deepest space photo ever of a galaxy cluster</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.kurzweilai.net/kaist-raptor-robot-runs-at-28-58-mph-faster-than-any-human">Developed a robot dinosaur</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/08/140821090524.htm">Developed an algorithim to track emotional state</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-29485996">A baby was born after a womb transplant</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_in_science">Lots of other stuff</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Humanity is truly amazing. Only a hundred years ago, most of the technology we take for granted today would seem like magic to them. In fact, bring your iPhone or Android back to 2007, and people will think you are a wizard. Our techonolgy grows and changes at a truly astonishing rate, and our quality of life improves significantly with every new step forward.</p>

<p>Bearing all this in mind, can someone <em>please</em> explain to me how this is still a problem that exists:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Nov/stupidtree.jpg" title="Spot the kitty!" />
	<p>Every year! Every single year!</p>
</div>

<p><em>“It’s not all bad,”</em> one might say, <em>“At least they make it so only part of the lights are off because one is burned out. You can find the dead one!”</em></p>

<p>I spent an hour trying to find the dead one, and I broke all my replacement bulbs in the search.</p>

<p>I think 2015’s goal plan should include Christmas lights that don’t suck.</p>

Lately it has felt like it would probably be a good idea to put some of my thoughts into a format that I can keep and share. I guess that I’m doing this because I want to start having projects in my life again.</p>

<p>The last few years have been crazy and tough and I never found time for me. Now I’m going to do the things that I want to do, and blog about whatever I feel like blogging about. </p>

<p>Join me on a quest to find myself or something.</p>

<div class="img-center">

	<p>Finding myself isn't as cool as Adventure Time though.<p>
