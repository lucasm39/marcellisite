				<p>Being Italian means I was raised very strictly Roman Catholic. Church every week, singing in choir, altar serving to the point of receiving a medal for my years of service to the Holy See. </p>

<p>Catholicism values family above most things, especially in Italy. Not going home for Christmas is one of the things that will set my dear mother off, speaking of which, meet my mom:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/mom.jpg" title="Snow!" />
	<p>What kind of psycho runs in this weather?</p>
</div>

<p>My mother Sandra is a wonderful person. She is really caring and will go to the ends of the earth to try and make anything you need happen. She’s a wonderful cook and I don’t think anyone else in the world can keep a place clean like she can. She doesn’t always get along with me, but that’s mostly my fault I guess. We just have really strong ideas about what the right things to do are, and they often differ. That being said, I wouldn’t trade her for anyone or anything. My mom is always on my side, even if I don’t realize it. The biggest thing I learned over the last few years is <em>maybe</em> I should listen to my mom. Her strength and preserverance while immigrating and everything she has accomplished since is insanely impressive.</p>

<p>Next up is my dad.</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/dad.jpg" title="Are those cops?" />
	<p>Sandra that tickles! Stop!</p>
</div>

<p>My dad Ezio is hilariously awkward. Soft-spoken and gentle, when my dad gets angry he is really angry. Very much the opposite of my mom in a lot of ways, but they work really well together. My dad has a great Italian accent and often misspeaks in pretty funny ways, but he always knows what to say to make me feel better when I’m down. My dad is an amazing artist and worked really hard along with my mom when they immigrated here 30 years ago. We went from being fairly poor to having a beautiful house and enough money to be secure and happy thanks to the hard work that my dad put in every day, and still does. He is also an expert craftsmen, redoing our entire kitchen almost by himself recently, along with my mom:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/kitchen.jpg" title="You did this yourself?" />
	<p>Who needs help. I'll just do everything! That way it's exactly how i want it.</p>
</div>

<p>My dad is a classic perfectionist and sometimes it grates on my nerves. The worst part is I can feel myself starting to become the same way. My dad is always on my side and I wouldn’t trade him for anything either.</p>

<p>Now for my brother:</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/david.jpg" title="I am the best chef" />
	<p>That beard tho.</p>
</div>

<p>My brother and I are very alike but not actually at all. Anyone who knows both of us will tell you that there have never been two more different personalities that are immediate family. My brother and I both enjoy the same things, but while I’m an outspoken, often annoying, energy filled whirlwind (unless I’m at home, then I just like lazing around), David is a very reserved, soft spoken and quiet presence. He is 8 years older than me but has never let that stop him from being close with me. My brother is one of my very best friends and there is no other person I’d rather have playing dota or cs with me. We like to get together and just play video games in the same room, or go eat out. David is also the most talented chef in the world (okay I might be biased). His food is the thing I look forward to the most when I come home, and every time I go to eat at his workplace <a href="http://www.buca.ca/king">Buca</a> I am always so thoroughly satisfied I can’t eat the next day. He is always behind me when I need him, even when he can’t actively do anything to help. I feel a lot stronger knowing that he is supporting me.</p>

<p>Next up is his wonderful wife, and my sister-in-law Jennifer!</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/jenny.jpg" title="So cute" />
	<p>What a cute couple.</p>
</div>

<p>Jenny has been a part of my family since I was 12 or something. David brought her home after his cooking class one day, and the first thing she did was help me with my french homework. This obviously made 12 year old me love her and I’ve never changed that opinion since. Jenny is always laughing and is the easiest person to talk to in the world. In fact, if you ever feel awkward and Jenny is around, just start a conversation with her! She’s amazing at keeping the conversation going naturally and seamlessly, and she can probably talk enough for both of you! Jenny is the best sister I could have ever asked for, and I’m not actually sure how David managed to land such a wonderful wife. </p>

<p>Now we arrive at the baby!</p>

<div class="img-center">
	<img src="/img/2014Dec/siena.jpg" title="So cute" />
	<p>AaaaaaaaAAaAAAaaAAaAaaaAAaAaAaaaaaAAAAaaaA</p>
</div>

<p>Siena is the child of David and Jenny. She is 2.5 but is the size of a 4 year old. Volleyball and Basketball might be in her future. She has a very unique personality and is awfully manipulative for a baby. Hanging out with her she will make you feel like you’re literally her favourite personÉ but then the next person will get the same treatment. She is the cutest baby I have ever met (lol bias, but actually look at her come on). I love her to bits and the hardest thing about being away for school is being away from this little bundle of joy.</p>

<p>Then there is my cat and Kelly, but they’ll get their own posts later.</p>

<p>I love my family. I wouldn’t trade them for anything. Everyone should take a minute to think about what you love about your family. I was almost in tears writing this because I realized how important they are to me and how often I forget.</p>

<p>Enjoy the holidays everyone.</p>
